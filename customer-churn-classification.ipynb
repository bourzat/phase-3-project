    "\n",
    "Customer churn is a significant challenge for many businesses, especially in highly competitive industries like telecommunications. Churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn is crucial as it allows businesses to take proactive steps to retain customers, thus reducing loss and increasing profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will stop using SyriaTel's services in the near future. By identifying patterns in customer behavior, the model will help SyriaTel's marketing and customer service teams focus their retention efforts on customers most likely to churn.\n",
