# Phase 3 Project: Customer Churn Classification

Author: [Ilyas Bourzat](https://github.com/bourzat)

## Overview
This project is focused on building and evaluating models to classify customer churn. The goal is to provide insights and actionable recommendations that can help a business retain its customers by identifying those who are most likely to churn. The dataset used in this project contains various features related to customer behavior and demographics.

## Business Problem
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, especially in highly competitive markets. By accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain these customers, thereby reducing the cost of acquiring new ones and improving overall profitability.

## Steps
1. **Business Understanding:** Define the problem, objectives, and goals from the business perspective.
2. **Data Understanding:** Explore and understand the data to identify important features and potential challenges.
3. **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and apply feature engineering techniques.
4. **Modeling:** Build and evaluate multiple classification models to predict customer churn.
5. **Evaluation:** Analyze model performance and compare results.
6. **Recommendations:** Provide strategic recommendations based on model findings.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains various features that describe customer behavior and demographics. The data can be found in the `data/` directory of this repository.

## Methods
The project uses several classification models to predict customer churn, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors

Feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model tuning were conducted to optimize performance. The relevant Python libraries used include `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
